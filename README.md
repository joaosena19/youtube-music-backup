This is a script that provides a sort of backup for Youtube playlists, in case you, like me, hate it when a song is copyrighted or deleted by the owner of the video.

What it does is basically send you an email with the name and channel of the videos included in a playlist, for that it is necessary that this playlist has a keyword for the script to know where to look for it, for example, I use "[music]".

If any song is removed, it will appear as 'undefined' in the email, so just look at the previous email and locate the song.

In the script it is necessary to change the variables 'myEmail', with your email, 'keyword', with the keyword you want to use. Then just select the frequency that Google Scripts will run, I recommend weekly.
